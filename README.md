# GenoMatch
Dating... but with genetics in play.

	Hello and welcome, introducing the Genomatch app.

	The purpose of GenoMatch is to allow users to choose their dating partners via similarities or differences in genetics.

	We identify up to 10 traits that a user selects, add up the scores the user gives for each of those traits, and find partners whose sum of scores best match the user's.
